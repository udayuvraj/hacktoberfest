#Improvements Made:
#Added Validation for User Input:

#The get_float_input function ensures that only valid numerical input is accepted.
#Checks for positive values for weight and height.
#Enhanced Output Formatting:

#BMI is displayed with two decimal places using f"{bmi:.2f}".
#Categorized BMI ranges with meaningful messages (underweight, normal weight, etc.).
#Code Modularity:

#Split the code into functions to enhance readability and reusability.
#Added a main() function as the program's entry point, which is a good practice.
#Error Handling:

#Ensures the program doesn't crash due to invalid inputs.
#User Experience:

#Added a welcome message and meaningful feedback based on BMI ranges.
#This version is more robust, readable, and provides additional features like BMI categorization.
